    "DOCUMENT-FT922-7917": "920515\n\n\nFT  15 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Nynex plans Japan-UK fibre optic cable\n\n\nA CONSORTIUM of international investors, led by Nynex, the north-east US\nregional telephone group, is considering installing the world's longest\nundersea fibre optic telecommunications cable, costing Dollars 1bn (Pounds\n565m) and stretching from Britain to Japan.\nThe group will outline plans next week to officials from many leading\ntelephone companies. It aims to hold a further meeting in the autumn, to try\nto persuade the companies to buy capacity on the cable.\nNynex stressed that the project was still in the early planning stages, with\ndetails of the cable's route, landing points and financing still to be\nworked out.\nOther members of the consortium are Marubeni, the Japanese trading company,\nDallah-Al Baraka, a Saudi Arabian bank, and Gulf Associates, a New\nYork-based firm specialising in Middle Eastern business.\nSome 95 per cent of the telecommunications traffic between the UK and Japan\ncurrently goes by satellite. The only cable linking the two regions via the\nMiddle East is one between Singapore and France. This is a co-axial cable,\nwhich is less efficient than fibre optic cable. However, a second fibre\noptic cable is being built.\nThe proposed Nynex cable would have much greater capacity than the Singapore\nones. Its 120,000 circuits would be capable of carrying 600,000 simultaneous\nconversations. Fibre optic signals are much clearer than satellite ones, and\ndo not suffer from time delays.\nThe Nynex venture, known as Fibreoptic Link Around the Globe (Flag), would\naim to complete the cable in 1996. It would have 14 landing points along the\nroute.\nNynex, one of the 'Baby Bell' telecommunications companies formed from the\n1984 anti-trust break-up of American Telephone and Telegraph, has been\nconducting feasibility studies for two years.\nThe move follows its failure to get US approval for a transatlantic cable\nbetween the UK and New York, because of the strict anti-trust court rules\ngoverning the 'Baby Bells'. These rules would not apply to a cable which did\nnot land in the US.\n",
    "DOCUMENT-FBIS4-30449": "\nBFN\n\n [Sylvie Lepage report: \"The South Pacific and French \nNuclear Testing\"]\n[Text] Suva -- Although the relations between France and\nthe countries of the South Pacific have improved thanks to the\nmoratorium on nuclear testing declared by the president of the\nRepublic, the recurring debate on whether or not it is necessary\nto restart explosions and the possibility of a decision running\ncounter to that made by Francois Mitterrand after the next\npresidential election still give the countries of Oceania some\ncause for concern. However, it is uncertain whether all the\ngovernments of this zone will react with the same virulence.\nIeremia Tabai, general secretary of the South Pacific Forum\n[SPF] based in Suva said: \"Relations between France and the\ncountries of the SPF have taken a turn for the better. However,\nany restarting of testing at Mururoa [a French-owned South\nPacific atoll and nuclear test site] would be a considerable\nstep backward. France has always maintained that the tests do\nnot endanger anyone, but we doubt this. The long-term\nconsequences are still not known and people fear them.\"\nFor many Polynesians and Melanesians who catch their food in\nthe sea, it is unbearable to think that fish could be poisoned\nand reefs destroyed. There is little point in publishing report\nafter report proving that there are no leaks or pollution. They\nwill not change convictions that are widely held among the\npeoples of the South Pacific. Cold reasoning and Cartesian\nlogic do not work against an emotional discourse. A French\ndiplomat pointed out to us that the people of Oceania consider\nnuclear testing to be \"rape and sacrilege.\"\nWhen the United States transferred their nuclear tests from\nthe Pacific to Nevada, France was perceived as being the only\ncountry that was active outside its own region, even though the\ntests were being carried out on French soil. Don McKinnon, New\nZealand's conservative foreign minister, asked us: \"If these\ntests are really not at all dangerous, why are they not\nperformed closer to mainland France?\"\n  New Zealand Activism \nNew Zealand is one of the few countries to have a minister\nfor disarmament, \"a strange creature, no doubt,\" Doug Graham\nsays of himself. He explained: \"As a small country, we have\nnever gone along with the idea that a few nuclear powers --\npreviously five -- could threaten the whole world and could have\nthe power, if things went wrong, to bring about the apocalypse.\"\nMr. Graham recommends that sanctions be brought against\ncountries which, like North Korea, refuse a complete inspection\nof their nuclear installations by the International Atomic\nEnergy Agency [IAEA]. Everyone we spoke to agreed that the fact\nthat new countries are looking to obtain the atom bomb in no way\njustifies the nuclear powers launching an arms-perfecting\nprogram implying a restart to testing.\nThis aversion is deeply-rooted in New Zealand. Former Labor\nPrime Minister David Lange (1984-1989) told us: \"At a time when\nantinuclear demonstrations in Europe were confined just to\nleft-wing movements, this tendency in New Zealand was much more\nwidespread, to the extent that the government itself led the\ndemonstrations. The fact that it sent one of its ministers,\nPaul Fraser, and two frigates to Mururoa to protest against\natmospheric tests merely strengthened New Zealanders in their\nconviction.\"\nThis indignation is now shared by most neighboring\ncountries.\nIt is above all the opposition to nuclear testing that led to\nthe creation of the Forum in 1971, an organization that aims to\nbe essentially political, unlike the South Pacific Commission\nwhich was then still under the aegis of the colonial powers.\nFour years later, New Zealand, Fiji, and Papua New Guinea\nmanaged to convince the United Nations to agree by a unanimous\nvote to pass a motion in favor of a denuclearized zone in the\nSouth Pacific. France and the United States abstained. In 1985,\nWellington's efforts resulted in the denuclearization treaty\nbeing signed at Rarotonga, in the Cook Islands, by the 13\ncountries of the Forum, with the exception of Vanuatu which\nconsidered that the text of the treaty did not go far enough.\nThe treaty specifically bans tests and the dumping of nuclear\nwaste in the waters of the zone.\nThree protocols invited the nuclear powers to apply the\nprovisions of the treaty in their territories situated in this\nregion. These were rejected by France, which had just sunk the\n[Greenpeace protest ship] Rainbow Warrior in Auckland harbor,\nand by the United States, whose relations with New Zealand had\nbeen frosty since Wellington had banned nuclear weapon-carrying\nor nuclear-propelled vessels from entering its ports.\nDespite the election of a new Conservative government in\n1990, Wellington did not revoke the law of 1987 which enforced\nthis ban. Jim Anderton, head of the opposition Alliance party,\nstated: \"Their deputies would not allow it. It would be an\nunacceptable about-turn for the people. We are proud of the\nfact that our tiny country has been able to say no to the United\nStates, even though our decision means that we are still\nexcluded from ANZUS (the military pact between Australia, New\nZealand, and the United States].\"\n  Danger to the Environment \nWhile there is no question of New Zealand going back on its\nantinuclear policy, France has nonetheless found greater\nflexibility in Fiji and Vanuatu since they changed governments.\nWhen Colonel Rabuka overthrew the predominantly Indian\ncoalition government in 1987, Fiji lost the support of its main\ndonators of aid -- a gap that France rushed to fill. In 1989,\nMr. Rabuka was awarded the Legion d'Honneur for services to\nLebanon...nine years after the event. Now the head of an\nelected government, Sitiveni Rabuka is calling on France, \"in\naccordance with the wishes of the people of the Pacific, not to\nrestart testing.\"\nHowever, as Steven Ratuva, director of the Fijian\nantinuclear\ngroup, points out: \"Rabuka is a soldier by training and, given\nhis links with France, it is highly unlikely that the Fijian\nGovernment would overly pressurize Paris were testing to\nrestart.\" Perhaps that explains why Sir Ratu Kamisese Mara,\nwho, in 1985, gave a speech at the UN General Assembly\ncondemning French nuclear tests on Mururoa, as Fijian president\ntoday refuses to grant us an interview on this specific subject.\nThis is the same man who, on a visit to Paris in 1988, received\nan aid package five times greater than the one awarded in 1987.\nIssue 17 of the JOURNAL OF PACIFIC STUDIES published by the\nSouth Pacific University (SPU) in Suva wonders whether it is any\ncoincidence that, for the following two years, the Forum toned\ndown its criticisms of France.\nIn Vanuatu, the position of Maxime Carlot, elected in 1991,\ndiffers considerably from that taken by former Prime Minister\nWalter Lini who, since 1980 (when the French-British condominium\nof the New Hebrides gained its independence), had taken every\nopportunity to condemn Paris, especially on the subject of\nnuclear testing. Since the French-speaking group came to power,\nVanuatu has been something of a bridgehead between mainland\nFrance and the countries of the South Pacific, and Mr. Carlot\nhas taken care not to cause offense to any of the parties.\nHe told us: \"France must take into account the wishes of the\nindependent countries of the South Pacific. We, like them,\nbelieve that nuclear testing represents a danger for the\nenvironment. If France can find other solutions to perfect [its\nweapon design], then all the better.\" \"However, those who are\ninterested in Mururoa must also take an interest in the world\nbalance, and my government will always be on the side of the\nfree world.\"\nHowever, here as elsewhere, everyone would be greatly\nrelieved if France could banish the doubts hanging over the\nSouth Pacific once and for all. The credit it has gained since\nthe then-Prime Minister Michel Rocard negotiated the Matignon\nAgreements on New Caledonia in 1988 by the implementation of a\ncooperation policy with these territories and the moratorium,\nwill then be unlimited.\n\n",
    "DOCUMENT-FT924-7492": "921116\n\n\nFT  16 NOV 92 / Two schools for scandal: Europe\n\n\nWith the eruption of the Matrix Churchill scandal over the illicit supply of\nmachine tools to Iraq in the late 1980s, the British government is\neffortlessly breaking all records for a run of self-inflicted political\ndisasters. Needless to say, the opposition has seized on the opportunity to\ngive vent to a gale of histrionic indignation; and the government has felt\nobliged to set up a judicial inquiry under Lord Justice Scott.\nSuch portentousness is overdone. Political hypocrisy requires an\ninvestigation, perhaps; but the investigation is unlikely to reveal much we\ndo not already know. Moreover, the investigation will not be able to pin\nresponsibility on one or more 'guilty men'; and it will not prevent similar\nincidents from recurring. Like the opposition, the government is just\nplaying to the gallery; but the script of the melodrama is all too\npredictable.\nPolitical scandals in France tend to be more entertaining. This may be\nbecause they have more experience in the making of scandals; or because\ntheir scandals are more intriguing; or because they sometimes break with\ntantalising slowness; but whatever the reason, the French usually manage to\nput on a better, or at least a more varied, show.\nOf the numerous French political affairs in recent years, one stands out as\na rather close parallel to the Matrix Churchill story. During the Gulf war\nof the 1980s, the French government had declared a ban on military sales to\nIran. But in 1987 it emerged that Luchaire, a French manufacturer of\nartillery shells, had sold about 500,000 of them to Iran over a four-year\nperiod, from 1982 to 1986; moreover, it had got around the export ban with\nthe connivance of key officials in the administration.\nThe government duly set up a judicial inquiry; but two years later the\ninvestigating judge closed it down, without a finding or a conclusion, 'for\nlack of evidence'. Since the essential evidence could only have been\nwithheld by the administration itself, this showed brazen chutzpah on the\npart of the government.\nThe more spectacular Greenpeace affair was handled rather differently. In\n1986 French secret agents sank the ship Rainbow Warrior in harbour in New\nZealand, to prevent it from intruding on the French nuclear test site in the\nPacific; the explosion inadvertently killed a Portuguese photographer on\nboard.\nTwo agents were offered as scapegoats to New Zealand, but no one in the\ngovernment took political responsibility. Only after a long and unseemly\nstruggle behind the scenes was Mr Charles Hernu, the defence minister,\ncompelled to resign. Mr Bernard Tricot, a grand panjandrum of the French\nestablishment, was wheeled out of retirement to investigate; but his report\nfound that no one was to blame. As Liberation said at the time: 'Tricot\nwashes whiter.'\nThe idea of ministerial irresponsibility was implicit in the government's\nhandling of the Luchaire scandal; but in the case of the Habash affair, it\nwas raised to the level of an absolute principle. In January of this year,\nthe radical Palestinian leader, Mr Georges Habash, was admitted to hospital\nin Paris for treatment. President Francois Mitterrand ill-advisedly blew\nthis up into a scandalous error of policy, on account of Habash's one-time\nlinks with terrorism. But no minister could be found to carry the can; so\nfive top-ranking civil servants were summarily fired, including Mr Francois\nScheer, the head of the foreign ministry.\nIt turned out, however, that this tactic of scapegoatism was no more than a\npiece of theatre. Even as he was firing Mr Scheer, President Mitterrand\npublicly praised him as a most valuable public servant; and within six\nmonths he had been found another top job, as ambassador to the European\nCommunity. That is the kind of denouement which calls for a spectacular\nspirit of insolence towards the voters.\nOne reason for the French practice of ministerial irresponsibility is the\npower of the presidency. If the president is the ultimate source of power\nand political legitimacy, it follows that his ministers are little more than\nhis executants. He may fire them; they do not resign on principle.\nSo it is all the more striking that President Mitterrand has just restored\nthe principle of ministerial responsibility, in the most sensational way\npossible. In 1985, the official French blood transfusion service supplied up\nto 1,500 haemophiliacs with blood which it knew to be infected with Aids or\nhepatitis. Ten days ago, the head of the service was sent to prison for four\nyears. But last week Mr Mitterrand electrified France by calling, in effect,\nfor parliamentary impeachment of the ministers responsible. It seems likely\nthe list will include Mr Laurent Fabius, who was prime minister at the time;\nbut since he has long been regarded as Mr Mitterrand's chosen heir, such a\nreversal of policy is dramatic indeed.\nThe explanation for the apparent reversal is not far to seek. The Greenpeace\naffair happened far away to other people; selling arms to the enemy as part\nof the export drive can be kissed off as part of the world of realpolitik;\nand the Habash scandal was not really a scandal at all. But the contaminated\nblood has caused, or will cause, hundreds of deaths in France; that is a\nreal scandal, not just one of the games governments play.\n",
    "DOCUMENT-FT933-16314": "930705\n\n\nFT  05 JUL 93 / France wants world ban on nuclear tests\n\n\nFRANCE yesterday responded to President Bill Clinton's decision to suspend\nUS nuclear testing by calling for a global ban on tests. A statement from\nPresident Francois Mitterrand's office said France was 'in favour of a\ntreaty banning tests completely providing it is universal and verifiable'.\nThe French have not carried out any nuclear tests since the former Socialist\ngovernment suspended them in April last year. However, nuclear planners are\nseeking a series of tests on two new submarine-launched weapons, the M45 and\nM5. French tests are undertaken at Mururoa atoll in the south Pacific.\nIn addition, prime minister Edouard Balladur has come under pressure from\nright-wing members of his centre-right coalition government to resume\ntesting. The National Assembly finance committee last week approved a paper\ncalling for the resumption of tests.\nMr Balladur yesterday said on French television that he was 'in complete\nagreement' with Mr Mitterrand. He said he and Mr Mitterrand planned to 'put\nour minds at rest' by forming a group of military and scientific experts to\nensure that France's nuclear deterrent did not suffer as a result of the\nsuspension of tests.\nBritish ministers say the UK can 'live with' a US test ban as long as it\nreceives assistance in computer simulation techniques to replace live tests.\nThe UK has to follow Washington's policy, since it relies on the US test\nsite in Nevada.\nThe UK Ministry of Defence said it had no plans to test elsewhere and would\nseek further consultations with the US. British planners are believed to\nwant tests to update the WE-177 gravity bomb, which will have to stay in\nservice beyond the end of the century, and to perfect safety features on the\nUK warhead for the Trident submarine-launched missile. However, the main\nprogramme of Trident warhead tests is complete.\nLimited further testing need not prejudice progress towards a comprehensive\ntest ban treaty, the ministry said. Britain has recently taken a more\npositive stance towards a complete ban, after previously only paying lip\nservice to the idea as a 'long-term objective'.\nIn the US Mr Sig Hecker, director of the Los Alamos National Laboratory,\nmade clear he had wanted to carry on testing right up to the implementation\nof a comprehensive test ban.\n'We would have preferred more time to prepare for the test ban,' he said.\nThe nuclear laboratories have argued that they needed more tests to improve\nthe safety of the US's nuclear arsenal.\nAfter a divisive debate in the administration, pitting the Pentagon, the\nState Department and the nuclear weapons laboratories against the Energy\nDepartment and the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency, the White House had\ninitially come down in favour of nine further tests - three of which would\nhave been British - in the next three years.\nMr Clinton's ultimate decision to extend the moratorium on tests, unless\nanother nation resumes testing, reflects belated recognition of the\npolitical reality that both the House of Representatives and, more\nsurprisingly, the Senate remained solidly opposed to more tests.\nThe decision to extend the moratorium will, however, provide comfort to\nRussia, whose Foreign Ministry on Friday called for urgent discussions 'to\nachieve a verifiable international agreement that will totally ban nuclear\ntesting'.\n",
    "DOCUMENT-FT943-1589": "940923\n\n\nFT  23 SEP 94 / Technology: Drugged by the deep blue sea - The oceans may\ncontain the ingredients to treat a variety of diseases, including cancer and\narthritis\n\n\nFrom the coral reefs of the Pacific ocean to the Antarctic, scuba divers are\nscraping barnacles from rocks, digging deposits from the sea bottom, bagging\nfish and algae and filling vials with seawater in the hope that their\nfindings will one day yield an important drug.\nMarine biotechnology is attracting the attention of companies in the US,\nEurope and Japan, many of which are searching the ocean for potential drugs.\nThey include Lederle, a division of American Cyanamid; the biotechnology\ngroups FMC and Martek; pharmaceutical groups Merck and SmithKline Beecham;\nand Japanese companies Nippon Steel and Mitsui.\nThe US government has set up a Dollars 45m (Pounds 29m) programme for marine\nbiotechnology research, and the Japanese government is also investing\nheavily.\nMany scientists are convinced that remote regions may hold the secrets to\ntreating dozens of diseases. Research in the world's rainforests in recent\nyears, for example, has produced drugs such as the anti-tumor agents\nVinblastine and Vinvristine, both developed from the Madagascar periwinkle.\nHowever, marine biotechnologists say the potential of the rain forests pales\nin comparison with that of the ocean. 'It comes down to the numbers game, to\naccessing the greatest biodiversity possible,' says Brad Carte, senior\ninvestigator in bio-molecular discovery for SmithKline Beecham. The oceans\ncover 71 per cent of the earth's surface and much of the life within them is\nstill a mystery. To many scientists this offers the possibility of\ndiscovering more potentially life-saving drugs.\n'The ocean is an untapped resource,' says Henry Linsert, chief executive\nofficer of Martek. 'It is a rich source of organisms. Algae alone makes up a\ntremendous amount of the plant biomass on Earth.'\nResults from marine biotechnology efforts have so far been mixed. Some of\nthe most promising compounds, such as the anti-cancer agent didemnen B, and\nsome anti-inflammatory agents have been dropped from research over the last\nfew years. Yet marine biotechnologists say failures in marine compound\nscreening, just as in terrestrial compound screening, are inevitable. In the\nlong run, they believe, they are bound to make some hits.\nThis autumn, Martek hopes to launch a fatty acid, DHA, which it discovered\nin marine algae, on the European market. The product will be added to infant\nformula to make it more similar to human milk.\nWith pollution and misuse threatening a number of ocean species, scientists\nsay they are concerned about losing marine biodiversity, and with it,\nvaluable compounds. This concern has lent their work a sense of urgency.\n'The ocean has been used as a dumping ground for a long time,' says Debra\nSteinberg, group leader for the Maine marine biotechnology effort at\nAmerican Cyanamid. 'Concern about pollution makes scientists feel that we\nshould try to find out what is there before it is destroyed.'\nMarine biotechnology is still in its infancy. No leading drug has yet been\nlaunched. A handful are in clinical trials in the US, mainly cancer\ntreatment hopefuls being studied by the National Cancer Institute, which in\nthe 1970s became one of the first organisations to engage in marine\nbiotechnology research.\nScientists say the small number of products in clinical trials merely\nreflects past lack of interest in the sea. With more companies now involved,\nmarine biotechnologists believe the next two decades will see a number of\nproducts moving on to the market and many more entering clinical trials.\nThree likely disease targets are cancer, arthritis and other inflammatory\nillnesses, and diseases affecting the central nervous system.\nIt has taken this long for companies to gain an interest in the sea, marine\nbiotechnologists say, because the modern pharmaceutical industry grew out of\na long-term human interest in the curative qualities of plants.\n'We live on land, and we've traditionally looked at terrestrial plants for\ncures,' says Gerald Weissmann, a professor of medicine at the New York\nUniversity Medical Centre. 'Most pharmaceutical companies don't have any\ndirect contact with the sea. They are based inland; they don't own boats,\nand they don't usually have a lot of divers or marine scientists on their\nstaff. That's why it has taken them so long to get interested in the ocean.'\nPharmaceuticals also faced practical barriers - it is only in recent decades\nthat long-term, deep-sea exploration has become possible.\nScientists also had difficulty replicating marine compounds in the lab. 'It\nis not that marine compounds are more difficult to synthesise,' says William\nFenical, professor of oceanography of Scripps Institute of Oceanography. 'It\nis just that we haven't had as much practice in that area, and so we are not\nas good at it as we are at synthesising terrestrial compounds.'\nScientists are excited by the potential of marine life. Barnacles clinging\nto ocean rocks may yield a special glue that would resist salt and\ntemperature changes and could play a role in surgical procedures such as\njoint replacement. Sponges, which fall apart so easily, could provide a clue\nto the prevention of cell binding and in turn lead to a treatment for\ninflammatory diseases such as arthritis.\nMarine life can be used not only as a source of compounds, but also as a way\nof testing drugs. The male contraceptive gossypol, for instance, relied\npartly on studies in sea urchins for its development.\nYet just as scientists turned from macro-organisms, such as plants, to\nmicrobes, many believe the emphasis in marine biotechnology will eventually\nbe in microbes. 'The state of the art is in microbes,' says Fenical.\nUltimately, one of the main challenges facing the industry may be political,\nrather than technological. The legalities of marine drug discovery are still\nnebulous. If a company develops a cure for cancer based on a compound found\nonly on certain coral reefs, for instance, the government concerned might\ndemand royalties.\nOn the other hand, many companies see the ocean as a far less regulated\nsource of compounds than terrestrial areas. 'As sovereign issues become more\nimportant in land research, such as in rain forests, companies may turn more\nto the ocean,' says Susan Clymer, managing director of the marine\nbiotechnology group NichiBei Bio. 'In international waters, it's still kind\nof a free-for-all.'\n",
    "DOCUMENT-FBIS4-54035": "\nCSO\n\n [Article by Huynh Cong Hoa, vice minister of marine products] \n[Text] Our country's seas have a rich and varied nature.\nFor generations, the ocean has supplied our people with valuable\nitems. \"Golden forests and silver oceans\" is an old saying of\nour people and a generalization about the rich nature of our\ncountry. Ocean resources in general and marine products in\nparticular have always played an important role in the national\neconomy and been viewed as one of Vietnam's leading economic\nsectors. Thus, exploiting, protecting, and developing our marine\nresources in conjunction with defending our national sovereignty\nat sea is extremely important both economically and politically\nand with respect to national defense and security. This is a\nlarge and complex problem. It is the task of the entire country,\nwhich includes the marine products sector. In this article, we\nwill mention only a number of problems so that readers can study\nthem.\n1. A number of natural characteristics and the marine\nproducts potential of Vietnam.\nVietnam's coastline runs for 3,260 km, passing though 13\nlatitudes from north to south. The ratio of the mainland\ncoastline to the mainland area is rather high: 1 km:100 square\nkm. The world average is only 1:600. Our country's various\ncoastal areas differ greatly in terms of climate, weather, and\nhydrologic and crop systems. Our string of islands consists of\napproximately 4,000 large and small islands, which includes two\nlarge archipelagoes, the Hoang Sa and Truong Sa [Spratly]\nislands. There are many coral reef areas and many bays and\ninlets that provide good conditions for many types of marine\nproducts to live, grow, and reproduce.\nThe monsoons and the geography of the East Sea have formed a\nspecial ocean current system that reverses direction in accord\nwith the two monsoon winds, that is, the northeasterly monsoon\nin the cold season and the southwesterly monsoon in the hot\nseason. The coastal tides are very complex, because they are\ncontrolled by both the terrain and the ocean bottom. The area\nnear the shore of the Gulf of Tonkin has a typical solar tidal\nsystem. The Thuan An (Hue) seaport area has an irregular\nsemi-solar tidal system. Other areas have mixed tidal systems.\nThe amplitude of the tides differs from one area to the next.\nThe depths of the coastal areas vary greatly. Every year, there\nis an average of 9-12 typhoons in the East Sea and approximately\n30-35 northeasterly monsoon winds that influence mainly the\nnorthern and central provinces.\nThe above characteristics exert an important influence on\nthe\ndistribution of the marine products and on the harvesting and\nprotection seasons.\nOn marine products: Based on many survey and research\nprojects, Vietnam's marine products reserves have been estimated\nat approximately 3-3.5 million tons. Approximately 1.2-1.4\nmillions tons a year can be harvested. Our country's marine\nproducts are rich and varied, and to date we have identified\nonly about 2,000 species of fish belonging to many different\nfamilies and orders. There are 1,600 species of crustacea, which\nincludes about 70 species of shrimp. There are about 2,500\nspecies of molluscs and more than 600 species of seaweed.\nBesides this, Vietnam's seas also have many types of marine\nproducts of high economic value such as sea slugs, hydrophiidae,\nabalone, clams, rays, sea turtles, sea animals, and oysters.\nBased on the different geological, climatic, and hydrologic\nconditions and different biological systems, our seas can be\ndivided into four main zones: the Gulf of Tonkin, the central\nsea, the eastern Nam Bo sea, and the western Nam Bo sea.\n2. The situation in exploiting marine products and security\nin Vietnamese waters.\nAs for the situation in exploiting marine products in\nVietnamese sea areas, our country's fishing industry is a\npeople's industry that is presently carried on mainly near the\nshore. We have approximately 68,000 ships and boats, about 80\npercent of which have been equipped with motors with a total\ncapacity of almost 1 million horsepower. Of these, about 80-90\npercent are of small size of 40 CV or less. The harvesting\nindustry is composed of 6 groups with more than 40 types, with\nthe most widespread being dragnet fishing, encirclement, draw\nfishing, hook fishing, and seabed basket fishing. There are more\nthan 300,000 fishermen and more than 500,000 people engaged in\nprocessing and rear service activities to support the fishing\nindustry.\nDuring the 10-year period 1982-1992, the country's gross\nproduction of marine products increased every year. In 1992\nproduction reached 721,681 tons, and in 1993 production is\nexpected to reach 793,324 tons. In general, production has\nincreased every year, but the new requirement is that quantities\nmust increase constantly and, at the same time, the sources must\nbe protected so that we can exploit these sources long into the\nfuture. Fishing activities today are concentrated mainly in\ncoastal areas from a depth of 35 meters or less and to the\nmaximum depth permitted (with bottom and surface fish).\nApproximately 80-90 percent of the fishing activities are\ncarried on in this area. Thus, activities aimed at increasing\nfishing yields are being carried on mainly in depths of 50\nmeters or more, particularly in deep-sea areas. Catches of\nsurface fish can increase to 160,000 tons a year.\nToday, the fishing industry is confronted by the reality\nthat\na high percentage of the marine products caught are not yet\nfully mature when caught. This is particularly true for shrimp,\na number of species of fish, and mollusca having export value.\nThis is a danger that must be dealt with promptly; otherwise, a\nnumber of valuable species such as groupers, lobsters, and\n\"diep\" face the threat of extinction. Along with this, there is\nthe use of inefficient fishing techniques and tools. In\nparticular, explosives are used to extract and kill many species\nof marine products, which destroys the ecological conditions and\nchanges the growth and reproduction environments of the various\nspecies of marine products. In just 1992 and 1993, more than 600\ncases were tried involving more than 700 boats that used\nexplosives to catch marine products, and [officials] seized\n7,685 kg of explosives, 544 mines, 14,884 detonators, and 1,046\nmeters of slow-burning fuses. Environmental pollution is\nincreasing because of industrial waste, waste matter emitted by\nships at sea, and waste matter released by the oil and gas\ndrilling platforms. Together with the destruction of the\nheadwater forests, mangrove swamps, underground reefs, coral\nzones, and so on, this has had a great effect on the sources of\nmarine products. Thus, the important and pressing problem today\nis to tie exploiting the marine products with protecting the\nmarine product sources and protecting the environment. This is\nthe only way to ensure an increase in productivity and yields\nand keep from exhausting our country's valuable marine products\nand ocean environment.\nConcerning security at sea, to date, it can be said that few\nof our country's sea areas, particularly areas in our\nterritorial waters and special economic zones, have been fully\nexploited. In recent years, disputes over sea areas and islands\nhave been very complex, and this will continue to be the cause\nin the future. This is the case in two main areas, the\nnortheastern sea and the southwestern sea.\nIn the Gulf of Tonkin, the Truong Sa [Spratly] Islands, and\nthe Bai Tu Chinh area, many boats and ships of various types\n(fishing boats, warships, seismology ships, ocean survey ships,\nand so on) from various countries have regularly operated\nillegally, with the average being 20-80 ships a day. The\nsituation in the southwestern coastal area is also very complex.\nForeign ships entering our territorial waters, illegally\nextracting marine products, and engaging in various activities\nfor a variety of reasons is a very serious situation. Each year,\nforeign fishing boats illegally catch more than 1 million tons\nof fish in our waters, which is more than we catch. Also, many\nforeign ships illegally survey our sea areas, cause\nprovocations, and threaten the safety of our oil and gas\nexploration and extraction activities. They also seize\nVietnamese ships operating and fishing in Vietnamese waters. In\n1993 alone, foreign ships seized 152 Vietnamese boats and 249\nfishermen and 29 ships belonging to the Ministry of\nCommunications and transportation and the Ministry of Marine\nProducts.\nThe above situation is posing a serious threat to the\npeaceful working life of our people, threatening our security,\nand encroaching on our national sovereignty at sea.\n3. Exploiting the marine products in conjunction with\nmaintaining the security and sovereignty of the state in the\nEast Sea.\nFrom the actual activities of the marine products sector, we\ncan see that the presence of Vietnamese fishing boats at sea,\nparticularly on the open seas and at remote islands, has\ncontributed to discovering, expelling, and seizing foreign\nships, blocking their illegal activities in our territorial\nwaters, and protecting the sovereignty and manifesting our\nownership in the fatherland's sea areas. In past years, many\nlocal and central fishing units that have worked together in\ncatching marine products have participated in discovering and\nexpelling foreign fishing boats and a number of foreign boats\nconducting seismological surveys in the East Sea by \"throwing\nnets\" fore and aft or surrounding the foreign ship, which has\nhad the effect of blocking or slowing the speed of the enemy and\nenabling border defense forces and naval forces to deal with the\nsituation promptly and force them to withdraw. Naval groups and\nfishing fleets of the Kien Giang and Minh Hai provincial marine\nproducts sectors have carried on fishing activities and dealt\ndirectly with threats by enemy ships. They have also expelled\nand seized foreign boats that have encroached on our territorial\nwaters. They have closely coordinated carrying on production\nactivities with protecting production and maintaining security\nand national sovereignty at sea.\nThe policy of having people go to live and work on the\nislands having the necessary conditions is a good way to tie the\nwork of catching and processing marine products to the task of\nprotecting our sovereignty and security at sea. On the Chau\nisland in Kien Giang Province, the policy is to provide help so\nthat every fishing household can borrow money and to allocate 20\nmillion dong to build houses on the islands and buy boats. The\nfishermen there have responded positively to this policy. On the\nother hand, the infantry forces on the islands have implemented\nmany positive measures to help the people build schools and\nmedical aid stations and enable them to carry on production with\npeace of mind and become masters on the islands and at sea.\nHaiphong has a policy of encouraging fishermen to establish\nenterprises on a number of islands in the Gulf of Tonkin in\norder to carry on fishing activities. The Ministry of Marine\nProducts has plans to invest in the material and technical base\nin conjunction with taking credit loans and borrowing money from\nabroad at a low or favorable rate of interest in order to build\nmarine products processing installations and repair\ninstallations and to buy boats, ships, and other means\n(approximately 100-120 boats a year of 100CV or more). In 1993,\non a number of islands, there were programs concerning\ninvestment capital. Based on the plans to expand the fishing\nindustry in conjunction with the program to move people to key\nareas and islands, along with building marine products\nproduction installations, attention must be given to developing\nthe cultural, social, communications, and information bases in\norder to stabilize the lives of the people, enable them to\nproduce with their minds at ease, and protect our national\nsovereignty at sea and on the islands.\nIn conjunction with naval and other forces, the Ministry of\nMarine Products must organize things to bring fishing fleets to\na number of important sea areas (such as the Truong Sa Islands)\nin order to protect the fishing grounds and ocean resources.\nWhat is even more important is that we must constantly have\nfishing forces in those places that are ready to coordinate with\nthe Ministry of Marine Products in order to manifest our\nsovereignty and protect our national sovereignty at sea.\nIn order to maintain large fishing forces on the open seas\nand in remote ocean areas, the Ministry of Marine Products and\nthe coastal localities must regularly organize things to enable\nthe fishermen to take long-term loans (10 years), medium-term\nloans (5 years), and short-term loans (1-2 years) at a low rate\nof interest to build large boats and purchase fishing gear and\nhave high productivity. At the same time, rear services and\nother services and product storage must be organized well so\nthat the fishermen can carry on production in remote sea areas\nfor longer periods. In 1993, fishermen on Phu Quy Island in Binh\nThuan assembled a 55-boat fishing fleet, caught marine products\nin the Truong Sa area, and earned revenues of more than 3\nbillion dong. This is a good example from which other localities\ncan gain experience. To ensure that the people stick close to\nthe remote fishing grounds, particularly those in important sea\nareas, besides the investments by the state and marine products\nsector in materials and techniques, naval and border defense\nforces must guide things closely, organize things efficiently,\nprovide support, and provide protection so that fishermen can\nproduce with their minds at ease.\nThe naval forces must also organize flotillas to make\npatrols\nand provide protection and also to catch marine products and\nprovide services far out at sea. They must coordinate things\nwith the fishing forces of the localities and marine products\nsector and create a broad fishing line on the open seas. Only in\nthis way will results be achieved in protecting and exploiting\nour sea resources and defending our national sovereignty at sea.\nThe ocean fishing forces require centralized and unified\nguidance. There must be plans to organize and protect\nproduction. Every fishing group must carry out the fishing tasks\nand also help defend and manifest Vietnam's sovereignty in\nremote sea areas. Attention must be given to applying the\nexperiences of the fishermen in order to formulate production\nplans and protect production. Plans must be formulated to\ncoordinate things closely between the armed forces and the\nproduction forces at sea. The ocean lines of defense and the\nall-people's national defense and people's security front at sea\nmust be solidified. Stability and safety must be maintained for\neconomic activities at sea. International laws of the sea must\nbe obeyed strictly, our national sovereignty at sea must be\ndefended resolutely, and peace and stability in the East Sea\nmust be maintained.\nIn order to carry out the tasks of exploiting, protecting,\nand developing the marine product resources along with defending\nthe sovereignty of our state in the East Sea firmly, we would\nlike to make a number of proposals:\n1. Intensive propaganda and education activities must be\nstrengthened for all strata of people, particularly for leading\nand managerial cadres, so that they clearly understand both\ninternational and domestic laws on the sea and have a deep\nunderstanding concerning national sovereignty at sea, on the\nislands, and on the continental shelf. Within this is the\nproblem of exploiting and protecting our sources of marine\nproducts along with defending Vietnam's sovereignty in the East\nSea.\n2. The state should soon formulate a policy giving priority\nto investing in ocean marine products research programs in order\nto have a basis for making forecasts, guiding fishing\nactivities, and effectively protecting the sources.\nInvestments in technical means and equipment and information\nmust be increased for the forces engaged in protecting our\nsources of marine products in order to coordinate things with\nthe naval and border defense forces in controlling the\nactivities of the ships at sea.\n4. Procedures and policies must be implemented to encourage\nfishermen to exploit the open seas and settle and work on the\nislands (give priority to them in making loans, give initial tax\nexemptions, build bridges and ports, and formulate cultural and\nsocial policies and procedures).\n5. We should expand international cooperation, particularly\nwith other countries in the region, concerning fishing on the\nopen seas and cooperate in surveying ocean marine product\nsources and in obtaining and storing products.\n\n",

The agreements define the\noperating and maintenance responsibilities for the cable.\nFlag (Fibreoptic Link Around the Globe) will be, at 17,000 miles, one of the\nworld's longest communications lines providing 120,000 digital circuits and\nserving about 75 per cent of the world's population.\nThe managing partner in Flag is Nynex, the regional Bell operating company.\nOther investors include Dallah Al-Baraka group of Jeddah, Saudi Arabia,\nMarubeni Corporation of Japan and Telecom-Asia, a joint venture between\nNynex and Charoen Pokphand of Thailand.\nTotal funding for the project is expected to be Dollars 1.2bn of which about\nDollars 600m has been raised as equity finance.\nFlag Limited, the operating company, said it had signed a Dollars 1.2bn\ncontract with AT&T Submarine Systems and KDD Submarine Cable Systems to\nconstruct the system. Construction is expected to beging in the first\nquarter of 1995.\nMr Gabriel Yackanich, Flag chief executive, said this week's agreements\nmarked the first cable system funded by private investors which will permit\ncarriers to buy capacity at true market rates.\n",
    "DOCUMENT-LA030690-0156": "\n\nMarch 6, 1990, Tuesday, Home Edition\n\n\n\n\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA JOB MARKET;\n\n\nREPORTS FORM THE FIELD;\n\n\nLEARNING A TRADE WITHOUT COLLEGE\n\n\n\n\nAfter graduating from high school in his native Canada, Chris Pepper took a few\ncollege courses and \"did a little bit of everything\" to make a living,\nincluding working for his father making contact lenses. When Pepper finally\ndecided on a career, he didn't want to take the time to go to college.\n\n\nInstead, he said recently, he enrolled in a program of mainframe computer\noperations and management at Computer Learning Center in Los Angeles -- a\nfor-profit trade school. Five years after completing the program, he is a\nsenior manager at Errico Technologies, a Los Angeles software research and\ndevelopment company recently purchased by Price Waterhouse.\n\n\nThe American workplace is changing rapidly -- increasingly requiring\nbetter-educated workers but not necessarily college-educated workers. The route\nto high-paying jobs taken in years past by high school graduates -- assembly\nline work in heavy industry -- isn't much of an option today.\n\n\nAt the same time, technology has taken on greater importance, creating\nopportunity for those who can operate computers and sophisticated machinery,\nand for those who can read well and comprehend instructions.\n\n\nComputer operators and technicians in health care and other fields are examples\nof plentiful jobs that do not require a four-year college degree. The best of\nthese jobs do require, however, a willingness to spend a couple of years in\ncommunity college or a few months in a trade school.\n\n\nSome industries and many labor unions also offer on-the-job apprenticeship\nprograms. Many electricians, for example, entered the profession through\napprenticeships. Southern California Edison fills many vacancies in skilled\nareas from entry-level workers who have been placed in an in-house training\nprogram.\n\n\nThe challenge for students looking at for-profit trade schools is to determine\nwhich will be useful and which are \"diploma mills,\" primarily in the business\nof collecting tuition rather than dispensing education.\n\n\n\"Reputable schools will want to provide information on attrition rates,\ngraduation rates and provide references,\" said Dan Parker, spokesman for the\nCalifornia Student Aid Commission.\n\n\nAnother tip: Ask companies in the industry you want to work in, 'Do you hire\ngraduates from XYZ school?' \" Parker said.\n\n\nFor those who gain the skills, job opportunities await. Many computer operators\nare starting at $23,000 a year, said Richard Perry, a Thrifty Drugs computer\noperator, who graduated from Computer Learning Center last September.\n\n\nIn addition, health care is aching for a variety of workers, said Kathy Barry,\ndirector of the Health Careers Information Center. The center was established\nby the Hospital Council of Southern California to cope with labor shortages in\nvarious positions, including many that require a year or two of specialized\ntraining.\n\n\nThe center has a public information program to make prospective workers aware\nof job requirements. \"Our goal is to increase the supply of workers for our\nhospitals by encouraging people to enter health care professions,\" she said.\n\n\nRadiologic technicians and medical records technicians are among the most\ndifficult health care positions to fill, Barry said. Employers generally hire\nradiologic technicians who have completed a community college program, she\nsaid, but some hospitals train their own.\n\n\nA beginning technologist in Southern California will make about $11.50 an hour,\nBarry said. But a radiologic technologist trained in a specialty -- such as\nultrasound technology -- will begin at a higher salary, she said. A community\ncollege-trained medical records technician will start at about $10 per hour.\n\n\nAlso, the health care industry has a critical need for laboratory assistants\nand technicians, and medical assistants to help doctors and nurses perform\npatient tests, review medical records and report changes in patient vital\nsigns, said Judi Hansen, director of regional recruitment services for Kaiser\nPermanente, the large health maintenance organization.\n\n\nEntry-level salaries for medical assistants range from $17,600 a year to\n$20,800, she said; entry-level salaries for laboratory assistants and\ntechnicians range from about $17,000 to $23,000.\n\n\nTo help increase the supply of nurses, the information center has referred many\nprospects to County-USC Medical Center, which operates the only remaining\nhospital-based diploma program for registered nurses west of the Rockies. The\ntwo-year program is similar to nursing associate degree programs at numerous\nSouthern California community colleges, said program director Marilyn Grafton.\nStudents must be residents of Los Angeles County or a neighboring county.\n\n\nThe major difference between RNs trained in two-year programs and those with\nfour-year college degrees is in the opportunities to advance into management,\nBarry and Grafton said. \"You need a BA to be a head nurse. Generally, a\nmaster's degree is required to be head administrator,\" Barry said.\n\n"
