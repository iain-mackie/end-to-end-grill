        '0': """Arsenal have signed Real Madrid attacking midfielder Martin Odegaard on loan until the end of the season.

The 22-year-old Norwegian has struggled to make an impact in Real manager Zinedine Zidane's squad this season.

Real Sociedad, where Odegaard spent last season on loan, and Eredivisie leaders Ajax were also interested.

Arsenal boss Mikel Arteta said: "Martin is of course a player we all know very well. Although still young, he has been playing at the top level for a while."

Arteta said Odegaard will "provide us with quality offensive options" and the Norway international could feature on Saturday in the Premier League against Manchester United (17:30 GMT kick-off).

Speaking about Arteta, Odegaard said: "He seems like a top manager and I liked his ideas, the way he sees football and also the way he is. He gave me a great feeling and that was important for me to come here. He was crucial.

"I think it's a club that really suits me well."

Arsenal technical director Edu said the club had brought in an "exceptional talent".

Spanish football expert Guillem Balague said Real Madrid blocked Odegaard going back to Sociedad because they wanted him to move to the Premier League club.

His arrival at Emirates Stadium comes after the departure of playmaker Mesut Ozil to Fenerbahce.

Odegaard joined Real Madrid from Stromsgodset in January 2015 and has played nine times for Real this season.

After returning to the Bernabeu in the summer following his Sociedad loan, it seemed he might become a first-team regular at Real Madrid under Zidane, who coached him in the B team when he first joined the club.

But after starting the first two La Liga games of the season, he has featured only once from the outset of a league game since - on 21 November.

Cooking techniques and ingredients vary widely across the world, from grilling food over an open fire to using electric stoves, to baking in various types of ovens, reflecting unique environmental, economic, and cultural traditions and trends.

Types of cooking also depend on the skill levels and training of cooks. Cooking is done both by people in their own dwellings and by professional cooks and chefs in restaurants and other food establishments. Cooking can also occur through chemical reactions without the presence of heat, such as in ceviche, a traditional South American dish where fish is cooked with the acids in lemon or lime juice or orange juice.

Preparing food with heat or fire is an activity unique to humans. It may have started around 2 million years ago, though archaeological evidence for it reaches no more than 1 million years ago.[1]

The expansion of agriculture, commerce, trade, and transportation between civilizations in different regions offered cooks many new ingredients. New inventions and technologies, such as the invention of pottery for holding and boiling water, expanded cooking techniques. Some modern cooks apply advanced scientific techniques to food preparation to further enhance the flavor of the dish served.[2]

Phylogenetic analysis suggests that human ancestors may have invented cooking as far back as 1.8 million to 2.3 million years ago.[3] Re-analysis of burnt bone fragments and plant ashes from the Wonderwerk Cave in South Africa has provided evidence supporting control of fire by early humans by 1 million years ago.[4] There is evidence that Homo erectus were cooking their food as early as 500,000 years ago.[5] Evidence for the controlled use of fire by Homo erectus beginning some 400,000 years ago has wide scholarly support.[6][7] Archaeological evidence from 300,000 years ago,[8] in the form of ancient hearths, earth ovens, burnt animal bones, and flint, are found across Europe and the Middle East. Anthropologists think that widespread cooking fires began about 250,000 years ago when hearths first appeared.[9]

Recently, the earliest hearths have been reported to be at least 790,000 years old.[10]

Communication between the Old World and the New World in the Columbian Exchange influenced the history of cooking. The movement of foods across the Atlantic from the New World, such as potatoes, tomatoes, maize, beans, bell pepper, chili pepper, vanilla, pumpkin, cassava, avocado, peanut, pecan, cashew, pineapple, blueberry, sunflower, chocolate, gourds, and squash, had a profound effect on Old World cooking. The movement of foods across the Atlantic from the Old World, such as cattle, sheep, pigs, wheat, oats, barley, rice, apples, pears, peas, chickpeas, green beans, mustard, and carrots, similarly changed New World cooking.[11]

In the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, food was a classic marker of identity in Europe. In the nineteenth-century "Age of Nationalism" cuisine became a defining symbol of national identity.

The Industrial Revolution brought mass-production, mass-marketing, and standardization of food. Factories processed, preserved, canned, and packaged a wide variety of foods, and processed cereals quickly became a defining feature of the American breakfast.[12] In the 1920s, freezing methods, cafeterias, and fast food restaurants emerged.""",
